  |   Get the city moving.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In Mini Metro, you take on the task of designing the subway layout    |
  |   for a rapidly expanding city. Your city starts with three stations.   |
  |   Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway        |
  |   lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as    |
  |   fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting     |
  |   commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to     |
  |   avoid delays.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Eventually your network will fail. Stations will open too quickly.    |
  |   Commuters will crowd the platforms. How long the city keeps moving    |
  |   is up to you.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Compelling, constructive, hectic, relaxed gameplay. If that makes   |
  |     sense                                                               |

  |   * 3 game modes: Normal for quick games, Endless for stress-free       |
  |     play, and Extreme for the ultimate challenge                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * 20 real-world cities to design subways for. Each has a unique       |
  |     colour theme and set of obstacles                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Supports up to 4 players. Build with your friends and argue over    |
  |     the best design                                                     |
